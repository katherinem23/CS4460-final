        <p class="caption">The line chart below shows the win percantage for everyteam in the 2022 - 2023 NBA season overlayed with the time top players on a team had an injury or returned from one.
            Between the red and green bars we can see how the win percentage changes while a player is hurt. To start we can see that the Bucks start off on a hot streak that comes to an end as soon as their top player Giannis Antetokounmpo is injured. 
            As you go through the team's and players, you can see how much more missing a player has an effect on losing teams compared to winning teams.
